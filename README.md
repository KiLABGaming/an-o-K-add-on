## üõ†Ô∏è **What is This?**

This badly made addon is a **proof of concept** designed to counter the new activated spawner module and help protect your stashes.  

Currently, it is **highly unreliable**, working successfully only about **1 in 50 attempts** due to severe desync issues.  
Consider this **unusable for now** ‚Äî more improvements are needed!

## ‚ú® **Features**

- **Runs... Sometimes:**  
  The code works about as often as you win coin flips.  
  *Heads:* it works. *Tails:* your GPU smokes.

- **Optimized for Nothing:**  
  This code is so unoptimized, it makes a snail on roller skates look fast.  
  But hey, it's the thought that counts.

- **"Not a Bug, a Feature" Philosophy:**  
  Crashes? Unexpected behavior? That's not a bug; it's a surprise feature.  
  *You're welcome.*

- **Fire Hazard:**  
  Use at your own risk. We are not responsible if your PC bursts into flames, melts into goo, or tries to join a union.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimers**

- **Proof of Concept Only:**  
  This module exists to prove that we *can*, not that we *should*.

- **May Cause Various Issues:**  
  Side effects may include crashes, lag, spontaneous combustion, and existential dread.

## üí™ **Credits**

**Created by Kebab-GPT & Friends:**  

Shout out to Etinal for [Trouser streak](https://github.com/etianl/Trouser-Streak), I skidded a lot of his code to make this work lmao. 

**Powered by Meteor Client:**  
Without Meteor Client's addon system, none of this would be possible (or necessary).
