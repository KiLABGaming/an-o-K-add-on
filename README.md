‚ö° Kebab-GPT's Slightly Functional Meteor Addon ‚ö°

What is This?

This is Kebab - GPT & Friends' groundbreaking, world-shattering, proof-of-concept module for Meteor Client. It's the kind of thing you build when you've had too much caffeine, too little sleep, and a wildly misplaced sense of confidence. This module does something (we think), occasionally runs (not a guarantee), and, when it doesn't, that's just part of the charm.

Features ("Features")

Runs... Sometimes: The code works about as often as you win coin flips. Heads: it works. Tails: your GPU smokes.

Optimized for Nothing: This code is so unoptimized, it makes a snail on roller skates look fast. But hey, it's the thought that counts.

"Not a Bug, a Feature" Philosophy: Crashes? Unexpected behavior? That's not a bug; it's a surprise feature. You're welcome.

Fire Hazard: Use at your own risk. We are not responsible if your PC bursts into flames, melts into goo, or tries to join a union.

Installation (For the Brave)

Download the code (if you dare).

Drag it into your mods folder and pray to your deity of choice.

Launch Minecraft.

Flip a coin to see if it works.

Disclaimers ‚ö†Ô∏è

Do Not Use in Production: Seriously, don't. This was a fever dream turned into code.

Proof of Concept Only: This module exists to prove that we can, not that we should.

May Cause Various Issues: Side effects may include crashes, lag, spontaneous combustion, and existential dread.

Created by Kebab - GPT & Friends: A motley crew of sleep-deprived minds and questionable coding practices.

Powered by Meteor Client: Without Meteor Client's addon system, none of this would be possible (or necessary).
